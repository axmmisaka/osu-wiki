[peppy](peppy "wikilink") reconsiders that his current business model will not obtain him his "Private osu! G6 Jet" and enables the *osu!coin* to hopefully increase revenue. Every current player is given 10 osu!coins to play (at the rate of 1 play = 1 osu!coin). These can be replenished after obtaining a combo of multiples of 100. Or simply by purchasing them at these rates:

-   1 osu!coin = $1 USD
-   10 osu!coins = $10 USD
-   1000 osu!coins = $999USD (Saves you 0.001%! BEST VALUE!)
-   Infinite osu!coins = Your first unborn child - osu! needs more team members, have your unborn child work off your debts! :)

The next day, [peppy](peppy "wikilink") decides to rollback on the osu!coins due to popular demand.
