Quality Assurance Team
======================

The **Quality Assurance Team**, commonly referred to as QAT, are the judges of quality control who will check recently qualified beatmaps for quality and playability, retracting their qualified status as a disqualification notice where appropriate. They form the bulwark of standard control and enforce the basic expectation of quality for all beatmaps that enter the ranking process.

QAT members will be held to strict activity standards as their role requires them to be regularly involved in assessing beatmap quality.

Members of this team will be promoted from [BNs](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators/), should they accept the new role offered. Members of QAT have a red name on the in-game chat and on the forums, whereas BNs only have a purple name on the forums.
