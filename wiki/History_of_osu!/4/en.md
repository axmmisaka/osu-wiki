A new version of of the osu!mania editor is being worked on. Taiko mode skinning now have a “metadata” bar (song title and artist below the playfield),taiko playfield is no longer transparent and fades in and out of kiai time. The original [FAQ](http://osu.ppy.sh/p/faq) has been superseded by the [osu!wiki](Main_Page "wikilink"). BanchoBot's !faq command has been open to public for [translation](https://docs.google.com/a/ppy.sh/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlsSAL_F7-xDdHhUUjNSa19QendtcTdYUjE2S2hnVHc#gid=24). The legendary [BanchoBot](BanchoBot "wikilink") finally has a [profile!](http://osu.ppy.sh/u/3) The user panels display now adjusts to display four columns on all widescreen modes. osu!mania now support vertical flip (upside-down), making gameplay similar to that of DDR/o2jam. Skinning now supports double-resolution sprites when the window width is greater than 1600 pixels. To add support to a skin, add images with double the width/height containing the “@2x” suffix before the file extension (eg: cursor@2x.png). Ranking support for [Hidden](HD "wikilink") and [FadeIn](FI "wikilink") mods in osu!mania and lastly, less widescreen limitations in the editor when it comes to placement and selection.

osu! received a complete overhaul of the User Interface (UI)! osu! Standard received a new leitmotif symbol (previously, it is a circle with "osu!". Now is a circle with "1"). Buttons on the editor has been updated. Special mode has been combined with Song Selection menu (named under "Mods"), making switching modes quicker and hassle-free. All [Game Modifiers](Game_Modifiers "wikilink") buttons received their respective image overhaul. Result screen now shows the beatmap's background image rather than user skin's result background. Hit-Offset can now be known by hovering to the Accuracy from the result screen. Do note that it will disappear and can't be saved. Online Results is now hidden below the result screen rather than forcing you to see it. You can scroll down to see or you can just click the button and you will be directed to the Online Results screen. In terms of skin, "osu!default by peppy" is replaced by "osu! by peppy" (art by [RBRat3](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/RBRat3)). Since osu! now can support both widescreen HD and standard size, a new button is added to the "Skins" tab under "Options". By default, old skin behaviour is used for compatibility and enabling the button will force the new skin behaviour to be in effect instead. At the Multi side, Host have a new special command called "Free Mods" and the "Game Style" is removed (Host can adjust the Game Style in Song Selection now under "Mods"). "\#userlog" is introduced to showcase your recent playing achievement privately.

Ranking scoreboard, on the other hand, received two revisions in a single month. The first revision is "unified scoreboards", where the scoreboard the separated into four parts (Mods, Friends, Personal Best, Local) with score difference given below the accuracy of the layer, the removal of local scoreboard and the inability to scroll to see more of the later Top score players. Despite it is limited to osu!supporters only, it received much criticism and as such, a second revision has been issued at the near end of the month. The scoreboard was basically revered back to how it was previously, keeping the score difference gap. The prominent addition is the tabbed drop-down menu, where it house various types of ranking scoreboard. However, the new types of scoreboard \[Country, Global (Selected Mod), and Friend\] are still limited to osu!supporters only, because further testing is required. Lastly, player's profile picture has been added beside the grade mark of their place in the ranking scoreboard. When hovered to the tab, the placement can be known as the profile picture is darken to show the placement number. Please note that this simple addition does not affect Local scoreboard in any way, as it will most likely to be flooded with your own play results with minimum to no intrusion from other players (unless the beatmap is received from other players in folder form).

This month of update are mostly made up of patching up the previous major update but that doesn't mean that is the end! First, it is the initial implementation of "Collections" support that will replace the long-standing Favourites A/B, making it simple for player to put in their favourite beatmaps in one "Collections" and able to share it with others by transferring the "Collections" rather than Favourites A/B.. Game modes can now be easily switched at song selection by using Ctrl+1-4. A new game modifier is added specially for osu!mania which is [Random](Game_Modifiers#Random "wikilink") mod. Some adjustment has been made on Multi's "Quick Join" button behaviour to direct you to a room with respect to your average pp against the room pp's deviation. For beatmap replays, stale-standing comment has been switched to moving [nico-style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Nico_Douga) comment style and comment colour can now be customised(for osu!supporters only). In the beatmapping side, all MAT members have became BAT members and MAT has been officially dissolved as the power boundary between MAT and BAT members are too close to each other.

Game Modifiers naming in results has been shorten (Hard Rock -&gt; HR) to decease the limited space usage. *Most* of the broken replays in the past have been fixed. A new spectator system where you can follow the spectator target if they are spectating someone else (refer to picture). The update system has been reworked, most notably it will no longer force restarts unless required. During replays, half-speed replay has been added (after pressing x2 Speed, it will show 0.5x Speed). The playfield will not flash out the background at 100% dim. Catch the Beat received joystick support (Up/Down: change song, Right: select, Left: exit). [A new ranking/modding system is in development](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/129625) (will replace the ancient forum-styled modding threads). For Multi mode, players can now use Special mod (Relax/Autopilot/SpunOut/ManiaKeys) when Free Mod is turned on by host. At skinning side, widescreen taiko(taiko @2x) default sprites have been added. Favourite A/B have removed completely and superseded by the Collections. Three brand new Dedication achievements for osu!mania have been released (40,000/ 400,000 / 4,000,000 keys pressed). User profile design has been reworked and your "last visit" will be based on connection to Bancho(that is, in-game login) rather than visits to the forum. Finally, osu! hit the milestone of having 10,000 users connected simultaneously!

[osu! Beatmapping Contest \#4](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/p/2324098) has started and will end at 1st of July. As a counter-measure against players creating lots of accounts, clarity of messaging during account registration is improved and infographic showing that you can't register from phones/tablets has been added to prevent players creating more accounts for personal reasons. Away with the security measures, users allowed to choose which game mode their profile defaults to (such as osu!mania, Taiko) and [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/) support to profiles. User profiles now have country performance rank on their profile and a new pp graph. In-game wise, main menu gets a new visualisation, with a blazing flare around the osu! symbol dependent on intensity of currently playing song's BPM. Performance have been optimised in song selection with many (&gt;10k) maps. Update process robustness and performance have been improved. Gameplay-wise, lead-in time is automatically add to any beatmaps which start abruptly to allow enough time to adjust Visual Settings and total press counts for each key on the input overlay is added. For online results storages, personal best rank is show on beatmap info pages besides the \#1 player. Score submission from mania charts is allowed and Top 50 replays is stored rather than the usual Top 40. Quick repeat sliders not reaching their maximum combo has been fixed. Disqus comments added to beatmap pages. Finally, prototype testing of score meter for all modes is underway for osu!test.

[The new regional BATmanagers](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/132667) began their first major recruitment of new BATs in to the team with the [Summer 2013 NewBAT Applications](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/142864/start=0). This provided a chance for the new managers to adequately handle new applications. The new regional managers were [NatsumeRin](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/natsumerin) representing Asia/Oceania, [Kurai](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/kurai) representing Europe, and [Garven](http://osu.ppy.sh/u/garven) representing America. On July 2nd, peppy made the [osu!api](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/141240) open to the public (previously available only through private requests). This allowed independent developers to work on third party services for osu!. On July 11th, the previously broken "forgot password" page has been fixed. July 18th brought updates to Bancho's fallback connectivity. On July 21st, widescreen support for storyboards was added in the song setup dialog. Two new in-game overlays were added to track accuracy as you play or watch others play. Refer to [Options](Options "wikilink") page for further information.

[peppy is confirmed for Comic Fiesta 2013 in Malaysia at 21st and 22nd of December in Kuala Lumpur City Center](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/163121). For Day 1 (21st), osu! is shown as a stage event, demonstrating the game in <abbr title="osu!standard, Taiko, Catch the Beat, osu!mania">four</abbr> different game modes. For Day 2 (22nd), peppy gives an insight of osu! along with his future update plans at the panel room and showcased osu!tablet for public to try it out. One of the current hot-topic for debate right now is that peppy is making a new game mode and is testing it as a proof-in-concept (testing if it's playable, competitive or flexible enough). Some players speculate it is [Tohousu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/19307) (dodging the bullet-hell, that is, inverse of [Catch the Beat](Catch_the_Beat "wikilink")). By time of writing, not much information is discovered about the new game mode. [A video clip about the talk is in ppy's blog](http://blog.ppy.sh/post/71405880656/i-have-a-few-posts-waiting-for-some-final-touches)

As skinning elements expanded, the element, playfield.jpg was removed in it's line of duty and replaced with a new generic one that was unskinnable. playfield.jpg was an element that allowed you to use any image as the default background of a beatmap, if one isn't supplied.

As always, many new things were added to osu! One being the new login screen. Another being the new system for scrolling in mania. It was to be based off of the beatmap's bpm rather than a fixed scroll! New intro and outro sequence and an awesome theme song were added into osu!, rather than a random beatmap's music to be played. And many discovering that osu! was pronounced as \\oss!\\, not \\osU!\\.

Lastly, leading to peppy making a tough decision to release *osu!test.exe* (now *osu!cuttingedge*) for **anyone**. This was to allow non-osu!supporters to *debug* osu! Where the newest (or latest) builds of osu! would be updated to any client. That is, if they're wanting to use it's unstable/experimental features. Every function was given in osu!cuttingedge EXCEPT for multiplayer (osu!supporter is required).

"Merry Christmas" as peppy wrote with an update that had snow (current game mode icon) falling in the main screen!
